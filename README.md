# PalFrOdo

## PalFrOdo is a collection of R palettes for discrete and continuous range of colors.

Based on the continuous need for finding adequate colors for different plots, we reasoned it would be good to have some to re-use when needed.

These palettes were created based on images downloaded from the web or from pictures taken by us.

Feel free to use them!
